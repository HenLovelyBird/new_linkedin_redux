/*
    All about Basic Auth. 
    Authorized Back End

    Create a Web Service that uses Basic Authentication

    BASE VERSION:
    Use static credentials.
    Create a service test that returns OK only if the user is logged in.

    EXTRA VERSION:
    Use custom authorization.
    Create in your database a "user" collection with username and password.
    Create a service test with two endpoints:
    - Register (username, password): creates a new valid user
    - Test: returns OK only if the Authorization check is passed
